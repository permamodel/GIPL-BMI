This version is same as https://github.com/Elchin/GIPL
EJ introduced some minor changes for convinience. These changes do not affect calculation scheme. 
The "code" folder has the original benchmarking version of the code, which will be used to compare "bmi-gipl" version. 
The "in" and "out" folders contain input and output files correspodingly, and should be used for comparison with the "bmi-gipl" inputs and outputs. 

To compile, go to the "code" folder and type:
> make

This will produce executable file "gipl" in the upper folder "../". 
To run the calculations go one folder up and run:
> ./gipl

Check output files in the "out" folder. Use these files for further benchmarking.
